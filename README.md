* RUBBER DUCKY

The USB Rubber Ducky is a Human Interface Device programmable with a simple scripting language allowing penetration testers to quickly and easily craft and deploy security auditing payloads that mimic human keyboard input. Write payloads in any text editor â€“ from notepad to nano.


* AWARENESS

When using this prank, we have to keep in mind that what we are doing can be taken as a threat, and could end up in legal action in front of a jury. Before pulling the prank inform your victim, use the situation as a way to show others how awesome and scary the Rubber Ducky is!


* USE OF THE PROGRAM
In order to use the program you will need to have Chrome on your computer, since the program was written for Chrome users, since it is the most used browser. In order to  use the program on your Rubber Ducky, you will need to remove the micro sd from your Ducky and use a micro sd reader, a usb adapter will work perfectly. After downloading the .bin (https://github.com/quiralte03/Change_Background_Windows/blob/a61a1d7cd044f81b833965bdda969440db616ae1/Ducky_Background_Change_Windows.bin) in this post, just add it to the micro sd, and install the micro sd back into Ducky. Now it only remains to put it on your computer and check that it works.
